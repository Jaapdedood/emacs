* Describe your personal background and any obstacles/challenges that you have overcome.
I was born in the province of North-Holland in the Netherlands. My motivation to move to the United States comes from high ambitions stemming from my parents' unlikely success story that I wish to live up to. My dad was the only child to a single mother and never finished high school. My mom never pursued any education beyond high school and tragically lost both her parents at the age of 22 in the Tenerife airport disaster of 1977. This left her having to take care of her two younger brothers and run her mother's kitchenware store alone. Fast forward 40 years and the two have achieved more than anyone could ever have imagined. A more than impressive history of entrepeneurship and endless hard work have brought them from dire situations to one where they are able to provide for their son to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering at a California university.

Everything leading up to me being a first generation university student in my family has left me extremely motivated, but at the same time has obviously placed quite a burden on me as the family watches on. This has played a significant part in the stress and pressures of my college career so far but, as I make my way towards graduation, my academic success has settled everyone's nerves as they have gained faith in my prospects. Now, I hope to finish my degree as good as I started it and become a successful engineer.

* What are your reasons for choosing your academic field(s) of study including any concentrations?
I have simply always been a huge technology nerd as I was always somewhat shy compared to my peers and would spend most of my time alone in my room. Much of this time was spent reading about the latest technologies, electronics, computer parts and experimenting with programming languages and other software on my computer. It has always been evident to me that I would go on to pursue a career in engineering or some other technology-related field.

I strongly believe that a better future has to be engineered. Almost every issue faced by society such as those in environment, energy, food, medicine and many more are mostly waiting for the technology that will help us progress past the current issue, as we have done in the past by improving agriculture, sanitation, vaccines etc. This potential of making the world a better place is another thing that has more recently enforced my interests in engineering and is why I have been comitting myself to organizations such as Engineers for a Sustainnable World, where we have been working on, for example, renewable and local energy distribution projects.

* Discuss your short and long term academic and/or professional goals.
My short term academic goal is to finish my degree as good as I have started it so far. I want to keep improving myself as an engineer and have a long list of goals I want to achieve before I graduate, such as getting a journal article published, that I will probably not be able to finish, but at least check off as many as I have time for.

In the long term, I hope to be able to work as an engineer at a tech company that is currently at the forefront of innovation. Whatever field this innovation may be in, I hope to be a part of it as I see no better way to spend my days than working hard to help humanity to its next stage of progress. 

After having worked in the industry for some years I would like to spend time at a university teaching and doing research. If this research is successful perhaps I could start a company of my own and provide new opportunities for young engineers like my current self.

* Discuss three academic, leadership, volunteer, community, and/or professional achievements.
The first academic achievement I am proud of is consecutive president's list honors and my current GPA of 3.9. I was no star student in high school and never thought I would score much higher than a 3.0 in college, but during my first semester at Long Beach certain professors opened my eyes to my potentials. This combined with an incredible newfound level of motivation lead to me soon exceeding my own expectations and achieving increasingly better grades when I was told by others that my grades would only drop from here on forth.

The second achievement is my success at my first job as S.I. Leader. I am currently teaching a supplemental instruction class for a second semester and, since I plan to spend time as a professor at some point in my career, I have been dedicating myself to be the best instructor that I can be. As a result I have built a great bond with my students both semesters and received only positive feedback on evaluations as well as a thank you letter at the end of the semester that made my whole year. My class of 21 students also had an average grade over 5% higher than the rest of the target lecture.

Finally, I am proud of my involvement and projects associated with student organizations at CSULB. With the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), I have lead a 20 person project named "sophEE" that aims to foster engagement in engineering and engineering organizations at CSULB through fun electronics projects. I taught this group useful engineering skills not taught in classes such as soldering and PCB design software as we built 20 bluetooth robots during the semester. With another organization, Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) I worked on projects that, as the name suggest, aim to contribute towards a sustainable world. Projects such as the solar kiosk and our hydroponics system have garnered large amounts of attention in university publications and media.

* Describe your financial need. Please explain changes in your financial or personal situation that will affect the upcoming academic year (e.g., parent's or spouse's contribution, job change, marriage, divorce, number of dependents, medical, etc.).
