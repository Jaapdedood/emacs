\section{Finding and simulating the Transfer function}
\label{sec:org843b4c9}
Initially for this lab, the transfer function found in the previous lab was used. This was calculated as follows:
\begin{gather*}
\text{OS}\% \approx \frac{107-101.5}{107} = 5\%,\\
\\
\text{OS}\% = 100 \cdot e^{(\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}})},\\
\\
\implies 0.05 = 100 \cdot e^{(\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}})},\\
\\
\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}} = ln(\frac{0.05}{100}) = -7.6,\\
\\
\implies \zeta \pi = 7.6\sqrt{1-\zeta ^2},\\
\\
\implies 57.76\zeta ^2 + 9.87\zeta ^2 = 57.76,\\
\\
\implies \zeta = \sqrt{\frac{57.76}{67.63}} = 0.92
\end{gather*}
peak time \(\approx\) 62s
\begin{gather*}
T_p = \frac{\pi}{\omega _n \sqrt{1-\zeta ^2}},\\
\\
\implies 62 = \frac{\pi}{\omega _n \sqrt{1-0.92 ^2}},\\
\\
\implies \omega _n = \frac{\pi}{62 \sqrt{1-0.92 ^2}} = 0.13 \text{rad}\\
\end{gather*}
Final value = 101.5
\begin{gather*}
T(s) = \frac{K \omega _n ^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta \omega _n s + \omega _n ^2}\\
\\
= \frac{1.72}{s^2 + 0.24s + 0.017}
\end{gather*}
However, when the step response of this function was plotted in MATLAB using the step() function, the following plot was seen.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image1.jpg}
\end{center}
This step response seemed far too overdamped compared to the results seen in lab, so the calculations had to be checked. After a long search, it was discovered that the value used for "\(OS\%\)" did not have to be converted to a decimal as the equation already multiplies by a factor of 100 on the right side. With this correction, the new values and transfer function calculated were:
\begin{gather*}
\zeta = 0.69\\
\\
w_n = 0.07\\
\\
\implies T(s) = \frac{0.498}{s^2 + 0.097s + 0.0049}
\end{gather*}
Which produced the following graph.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image2.jpg}
\end{center}
This looks a lot more like the response seen in lab.\newline\newline
The time domain step response was then also found and plotted using the relationship:
\[Y(s) = G(s)*X(s)\]
and the Matlab functions "ilaplace()" and "ezplot()". This produced the following graph.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image3.jpg}
\end{center}
Which is clearly the same response as seen before using the "step()" function. Compared to the response seen in lab, overshoot\% and peak times are identical. The only difference is the behaviour after the initial peak, as the heater cycled on and off in the lab to maintain temperature, causing constant ripple after the initial peak. The plot of the transfer function assumes the input energy of the heater will match environment heat loss and the temperature reaches a stable 101.5 F.\newline\newline
Using the "damp()" function on our defined transfer function produced the following output:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image4.jpg}
\end{center}
The function simply calculates the natural frequencies, damping ratios, time constants, and poles of the transfer function. In this case the frequency \(\omega_{\text{n}}\) and damping coefficient \(\zeta\) calculated earlier are displayed. The denominator has also been solved for s to find the poles of the transfer function and the time constant is calculated by \(\tau = \frac{1}{\omega _n \zeta}\). The damping coefficient, \(\zeta\), calulated is < 1 hence the system is underdamped. This explains the overshoot and undershoot as the system approaches its rest position. The full MATLAB code used is included.
\begin{verbatim}
% TF variables
clear,clc
K = 101.5;
zeta = 0.69;
w0 = 0.07;

%% Using tf
G1 = tf(K*w0^2, [1,2*zeta*w0,w0^2]);
step(G1);

%% using zpk
numerator = K*w0^2;
zeros = roots(numerator);
denom = [1 2*zeta*w0 w0^2];
poles = roots(denom);
G2 = zpk(zeros, poles, numerator);
step(G2);

%% using syms
syms s t
G3 = (K*w0^2)/(s^2+2*zeta*w0*s+w0^2);
%step(G3(s)) - does not work

%% Finding the step response
X = 1/s; %Step function input
Y = G3*X; %Response
y(t) = ilaplace(Y) %Time domain step response
ezplot(y(t), [0, 140, 0, 120]);

%% Second Order Transfer Functions
damp(G2)
\end{verbatim}
\section{Simulink models}
\label{sec:orgd42a42a}
In this part of the lab, the system was modeled using Simulink. First, the on/off control method was modeled using the following simulink model
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image6.jpg}
\end{center}
The "MATLAB Function" inserted into the model is a simple script which simulates turning on the heater below 101.5F and off above the same temperature. This is analogous to the BASIC Stamp code uploaded to the controller used in lab. The following output was produced.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image5.jpg}
\end{center}
This looks a little like the plot produced in lab except with a much larger undershoot every time the timer is turned off. Like in the lab, differential gap control was tested next to try and improve the system response This was done using the following model.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image7.jpg}
\end{center}
Where the relay was configured to turn on and off between varying bandgaps, however, none of these settings improved the response. For example, this response where the relay was configured to turn on or off between 106 and 97.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image8.jpg}
\end{center}
The model with this particular transfer function has a very large undershoot even when the delay is removed. A more accurate transfer function/model would have to be designed to accurately simulate the results seen in lab.\newline\newline
Adding a gain of 2 in the feedback loop as follows:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image9.jpg}
\end{center}
Largely increases the undershoot and overshoot, so is not desired.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image10.jpg}
\end{center}
A gain of less than 1 simply causes the transfer function to not reach the magnitude desired.

\section{Complete Plant Transfer Function}
\label{sec:org4856558}
\begin{equation*}
T(s) = \frac{0.498}{s^2 +0.097s+0.0049} = \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}\\

\implies 0.498R(s) = s\(^{\text{2}}\)+0.097s+0.0049Y(s)\\

\implies 0.498r = y''+0.097y'+0.0049\\

\implies s\(^{\text{2}}\) Y(s)-sy(0)-y'(0)+0.097[s(Y(s)-y(0)]+0.0049Y(s)\\

= Y(s)[s\(^{\text{2}}\)+0.097s+0.0049]-70s-6.79=0.498R(s)\\

\implies Y(s) = \frac{70s+6.79}{s^2+0.097s+0.0049}+\frac{0.498}{s(s^2+0.097s+0.0049)} = \frac{70s^2 + 6.79s + 0.498}{s^3 + 0.097s^2 + 0.0049s}\\

\implies T(s) = \frac{70s^2 + 6.79s + 0.498}{s^2 + 0.097s + 0.0049}\\

\end{equation}
In MATLAB:
\begin{verbatim}
clear,clc
numerator = [70 16.8 0.498];
denominator = [1 0.097 0.0049];
Gt = tf(numerator, denominator)
step(Gt)
damp(Gt)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image13.jpg}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image12.jpg}
\end{center}
As can be seen, the transfer function now begins at 70 instead of 0 but follows the same shape and overshoot as the previous graphs.
