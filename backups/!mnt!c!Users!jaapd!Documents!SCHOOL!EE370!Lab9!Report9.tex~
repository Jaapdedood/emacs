\section{Activity 1}
\label{sec:org7c8965e}
In this activity we investigated using On-Off control using the circuit from last lab. On-off control is the simplest form of closed loop control. For example, In our case where we are trying to control the temperature using a heater, a certain temperature will be set as our "setpoint," and the heater will turn on if the current temperature is below the setpoint, and turn off if it is above the setpoint temperature. Performing this experiment at a setpoint of 101.5F produced the following graph.

\end{center}
The main disadvantages of on-off can be seen on the graph. First of all, as the the temperature goes from below the setpoint to above the set point or vice versa, there can be quite some overshoot and undershoot, especially the first time the heater is turned on. This can be seen on the graph as the temperature rises to the setpoint and the heater is turned off, but the temperature still continues rising for a short time. This is because the heater may be turned of but it is still conducting heat to the sensor. Likewise, there is undershoot as the heater takes some time to heat back up and begin raising the temperature of the sensor after it is turned off. Furthermore, the output may cycle rapidly between on and off as the measurement passes the set point. This could cause unwanted noise and be damaging to moving components such as relays. Some form of debouncing, either by software or hardware could be implemented to avoid this problem. Naturally the system will also cycle between on and off as, for example, in this circuit heat is added and dissipated. This will not cause too much noise in systems where the changes in measurement do not happen rapidly. For example, if the incubator was insulated very well there would be not much heat dissipation and on-off control would suffice. Hence on-off control is suitable for any application that can tolerate slow responses and remains fairly stable.
\section{Activity 2}
\label{sec:orgeb1021d}
In this activity, a similar control system was used, however, this time instead of setting a single set point, a minimum-maximum range was specified. This is named differential gap control as there is a gap between the minimum and maxmimum measurements to prevent the system from rapidly cycling between on and off. The response of the new system was plotted.
\begin{center}

\end{center}
The graph shows that a larger gap between min and max allows for more temperature variation, but the heater has to cycle on and off less often. likewise, when the gap is reduced in size, the heater has to switched on and off more often but stays within a smaller range. This kind of system eliminates much of the disadvantages of an on-off systems such as the rapid cycling around the set-point and allows you to configure the level of noise to your requirements to some extent.
\section{Theoretical Exercise}
\label{sec:orgd3fd087}
Using Figure 7-5:

Peak temperature \(\approx\) 107F
\begin{gather*}
\text{OS}\% \approx \frac{107-101.5}{107} = 5\%,\\
\\
\text{OS}\% = 100 \cdot e^{(\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}})},\\
\\
\implies 0.05 = 100 \cdot e^{(\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}})},\\
\\
\frac{-\zeta \pi}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta ^2}} = ln(\frac{0.05}{100}) = -7.6,\\
\\
\implies \zeta \pi = 7.6\sqrt{1-\zeta ^2},\\
\\
\implies 57.76\zeta ^2 + 9.87\zeta ^2 = 57.76,\\
\\
\implies \zeta = \sqrt{\frac{57.76}{67.63}} = 0.92
\end{gather*}
peak time \(\approx\) 62s
\begin{gather*}
T_p = \frac{\pi}{\omega _n \sqrt{1-\zeta ^2}},\\
\\
\implies 62 = \frac{\pi}{\omega _n \sqrt{1-0.92 ^2}},\\
\\
\implies \omega _n = \frac{\pi}{62 \sqrt{1-0.92 ^2}} = 0.13 rad\\
\end{gather*}
Final value = 101.5
\begin{gather*}
T(s) = \frac{K \omega _n ^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta \omega _n s + \omega _n ^2}
\end{gather*}
