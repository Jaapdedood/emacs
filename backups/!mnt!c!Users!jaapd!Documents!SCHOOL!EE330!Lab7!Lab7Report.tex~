\section{Abstract:}
\label{sec:orgbed5e72}
In this lab a common source MOSFET amplifier was designed and built for a \textasciitilde{}100mA operating point. A graphical procedure was followed to decide the design values and the gain produced was measured to be a factor of 4.2. The output resistance was measured and found to be about 40\(\Omega\). The results were found to be valid compared to theory and compared with the results observed using JFETs and BJTs.
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgfc844ca}
A metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) operates similarly to a JFET. A depletion-mode MOSFET, in fact, is functionally identical but with a different semiconductor structure and slightly different parameters. An enhancement-mode MOSFET consists of either an n or p type substrate the makes up most of the device, two terminals of the opposite type labeled the drain and source and a metal oxide layer insulating a gate terminal from the substrate. without a voltage applied to the gate, the path from drain to source consists of two back-to-back p-n junctions which will only let a negligible amount of current through. When a voltage is applied to the gate, this electric field will attract either electrons or holes and repel the other, depending on whether it is a positive or negative voltage applied.\newline\newline
Assuming an n-type MOSFET, the drain and source terminals will be n-type and a positive voltage will be applied to the gate to attract electrons and repel holes in the p-substrate. This will cause an area between the drain and source that has a high concentration of electrons and is thus effectively n-type. Now, current can flow through the all n-type channel from drain to source. The gate to source voltage required to create this channel is known as the threshold voltage, V\(_{\text{TH}}\). Since there is also a voltage applied to V\(_{\text{D}}\) for biasing, V\(_{\text{GS}}\) > V\(_{\text{GD}}\). This causes the channel, which is dependent on electric field and thus voltage, to become shallower toword the drain. If V\(_{\text{DS}}\) is increased to the point that \(V_{GD} \leq V_{TH}\), then the channel is pinched off and the device is in saturation. This is similar to the pinch-off voltage in a JFET.\newline\newline
Despite the differences in structure, the output characteristics of a MOSFET are expected to look very much like those of a JFET except, for an n-type MOSFET, V\(_{\text{GS}}\) must be forward biased. The design procedure, therefore, is similar too. An acceptable range of output current, I\(_{\text{D}}\), is chosen by marking the operating points on the output curves for a wide channel and narrow channel as I\(_{\text{D}_{\text{min}}}\) and I\(_{\text{D}_{\text{max}}}\). A line is then extrapolated to the horizontal axis to find V\(_{\text{G}}\) and R\(_{\text{S}}\) since
\[R_S = \frac{\Delta V_{GS}}{\Delta I_D}\]
So the slope of the line is \(\frac{1}{R_S}\). Knowing these values, all that remains is to choose some large resistors to bias the gate with the desired V\(_{\text{G}}\) and find an acceptable value for R\(_{\text{D}}\). R\(_{\text{D}}\) can be found by letting the voltage difference between V\(_{\text{GS}}\) at the operating point and the threshold voltage = V\(_{\text{DS}}\) and subsequently dividing by I\(_{\text{D}}\) to find R\(_{\text{D}}\). An extra volt or two may be required to prevent the output voltage from being distorted if the output voltage swing causes V\(_{\text{GS}}\) to drop below V\(_{\text{TH}}\). Now, we can chose R\(_{\text{D}}\) by:
\[V_{R_D} = V_{DD} - V_{DS} - V_O - V_{R_S}\]
Keeping in mind that a larger R\(_{\text{D}}\) will increase voltage gain, since:
\[A_V = -g_mR_D\]
Where g\(_{\text{m}}\) is the mutual transconductance. g\(_{\text{m}}\) can be found by taking the slope of the tangent line to the operating point. Hence, if a high gain is required, one may choose a point on the characteristic curve with a steep upward slope, but also at a low current value, as a higher current value will require a lower R\(_{\text{D}}\) value for biasing.\newline\newline
With all this in mind, the following circuit was designed for an operating point between 70 and 140mA:

The MOSFET used was a BS170 n-channel MOSFET. The V\(_{\text{G}}\) applied is much higher than required for our given range of I\(_{\text{D}}\) but was used anyway due to the lack of resistor values available. Using the estimated characteristic curve drawn for our device, a typical value for I\(_{\text{D}}\) can be estimated and was used to choose a value for R\(_{\text{D}}\). Using this value of R\(_{\text{D}}\) an estimate can also be made for the theoretical value of the gain. Using the typical value of g\(_{\text{m}}\) given by the device's datasheet as 200mS, a gain is expected of \(A_V = (33\Omega)(200mS) = 6.6\).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:orga666f12}
One issue encountered in this lab was the relatively high power levels associated with a 100mA current. since \(P = I^2 R\), and the resistors used are rated for 1/4 Watt, a resistance above 25\(\Omega\) will cause the resistor to smoke at 100mA. An R\(_{\text{D}}\) above 25\(\Omega\) was desired, however, so three 100\(\Omega\) resistors in parallel were used to share the power and dissipate about 0.33W/3 = 0.11W each. This makes them fairly hot but not to dangerous levels.\newline\newline
With the power issue solved, the design could now be tested to measure the gain. The measured gain of 4.2 means the g\(_{\text{m}}\) of this FET can be calculated as \(g_m = \frac{A_V}{33} = 127mS\). This is a 36\% difference from the typical value of 200mS indicated by the data sheet but such a variation is not uncommon.\newline\newline
The voltage gain of this amplifier is low compared to that of a BJT amplifier circuit and comparable to that of a JFET. So far, almost all of the characteristics of a MOSFET have appeared similar to those of a JFET, however, JFETs have become mostly obsolete because MOSFETs have a few distinct advantages. Even though the input resistance of a JFET is very high, The input resistance of a MOSFET is multiple orders of magnitude higher thanking to the insulated gate. This also further reduces the gate leakage current. These advantages have made MOSFETs much more popular and abundant, making them cheaper to purchase than JFETs.\newline\newline
As these devices do not produce a significant voltage gain, as seen in this lab, they are most commonly used as switching devices. They can be seen as devices with an very high current gain, as a base current of only a few nA can control a signal over 9 orders of magnitude larger. A BJT also produces significant current gain but the base current is usually only a 10th or so of the output current.
