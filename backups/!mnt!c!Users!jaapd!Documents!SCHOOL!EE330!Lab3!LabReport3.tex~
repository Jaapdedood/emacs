\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:orgbb24569}
In this experiment, an unregulated and regulated power supply was designed, built and the average and ripple voltages were measured. Then, the load resistance was altered and two different filter capacitors were used to observe the effects on the ripple voltage. Next the line voltage was varied and, again, the effect on ripple voltage was observed. This was repeated for a regulated power supply. Finally a diode protection circuit was designed, tested and added to the circuit.
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc220bee}
"Rectifier" diodes obtain their name from their common use for rectification: converting an alternating current to a direct current. This is achieved by simply placing the diode in series with the alternating voltage source, allowing the current to only flow in one direction. In a simple circuit with a sine wave input source, a diode and a resistive load this will produce the following inpit/output:
\begin{center}

\captionof{figure}{Half-wave rectifier}
\end{center}
This circuit is a half-wave rectifier, as the negative half of the sine wave is completely filtered out. To create a more stable output we must construct a full-wave rectifier. This is done using a centre tap transformer. The center tap of the transformer is connected to ground and an extra diode is added to the circuit on the negative side of the AC input. This way, current is passed to the resistor on the positive and negative outputs of the AC source as can be seen in the input/output graphs for this circuit:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250px]{image2.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Full-wave rectifier}
\end{center}
Although this circuit delivers DC power to the load, the output is still not stable as it constantly varies between zero and peak voltage. This can be addressed by adding an appropriate filter capacitor along the load. This smoothens out the output since the capacitor will charge and discharge as the voltage varies, keeping the voltage across the load relatively stable. This makes our circuit a full-wave peak rectifier.\newline\newline
To calculate an appropriate capacitor value, we must take the time of half a cycle, as this is how long the capacitor must discharge for, and choose a capacitor that will discharge for much longer. A capacitor with a too high capacitance will produce an output with very little ripple but with high current pulses. A good balance between little ripple and current pulses is usually found by choosing a capacitor with a time constant 5 times the required discharge time. For a 60Hz input, \(t = 1/f = 1/60 = 0.0167s\), so for half a wave the time the capacitor must discharge is roughly \(0.167s/2 = 8.3ms\). Hence, we want a time constant of about \(5\cdot 8.3 = 41.5ms\). We know for a capacitor \(\tau = R \c
dot C\) so for a 50\(\Omega\) load, a good capacitor value would be \(C_F = \frac{41.5 \times 10^{-3}}{50} = 830\mu F\). Hence, any capacitor between 700-900\(\mu\) F should produce a fairly steady DC output.

\end{center}
This is still not a hugely useful circuit, however, since the voltage across the load will alter as the load and the line voltage are altered. This is what will be observed in our experiment. The fix the issue of a varying supply, a 3-pole regulator can be added to the circuit. Adding a 3-pole regulator with the desired output voltage before the load will keep the output voltage to the load fixed as long as the voltage remains above the minimum voltage required by the regulator. The regulator will also almost completely eliminate ripple to the load. Now, we have finally designed a power supply that can be used to supply a device with DC. This circuit will also be built and tested in the lab.\newline\newline
Finally, a diode protection circuit was designed to limit the input terminals of a theoretical sensitive amplifier to a range of +/- 12V when the supply voltage is +/- 10V. A popular way of doing this using diodes is to position the diodes as clipping diodes. The easiest way of doing this is using zener diodes, as this doesn't require an external supply. By placing two zener diodes in opposite directions shorted to ground as shown in figure 4 will short the signal to ground if it surpasses the breakdown voltage of the zener diode.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250px]{image4.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Zener diode transient voltage suppressor}
\end{center}
To limit the voltage to the load in figure 4 to +/- 12V, zener diodes with a 9.2-11.2V zener voltage are required (subtracting 0.8V drop for the forward biased zener diode). Since these diodes were not available for this lab, regular signal diodes were used in a design for a similar clipping circuit using the +/- 10V supply voltage.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=250px]{image5.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Diode clipping circuit}
\end{center}
In the circuit in figure 5 the diodes are positioned so that if the voltage exceeds +/- 10V + 0.7V diode drop, the diodes will conduct, clipping the voltage to +/- 10.7V.
\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:org540ffbf}
\subsection{Unregulated DC power supply}
\label{sec:org6e5fd0b}
To build the circuit in figure 3, a 20Vrms transformer was used and initially an 82\(\Omega\) load and 5000\(\mu\) F filter capacitor were used. Then, the load resistance was reduced to 47\(\Omega\) and a 64000\(\mu\) F capapcitor was used. Each time, the average voltage and ripple voltage were measured using a digital multimeter and an oscilloscope. Then, the AC voltage supplied to the transformer was altered using a VARIAC variable transformer. The voltage was altered from 91.5-134.3V and the average and ripple voltage were measured again, keeping R\(_{\text{L}}\) and C\(_{\text{F}}\) constant.
\subsection{5V regulated power supply}
\label{sec:org63b5792}
An LM7805 5V regulator was added to the circuit and the supply voltage was again altered to obsereve differences in the average output voltage with a 47\(\Omega\) and 82\(\Omega\) load resistor.
\subsection{Diode protection circuit}
\label{sec:org3083206}
The circuit in figure 5 was built. The +/-10V references were obtained by setting two channels from a DC power to 10V and connecting them in series. This is done by connecting one of the channel's negative terminal to the positive terminal of the second channel. Now, one power supply will have a +10V terminal and the other a -10V terminal. These terminals were connected to the diodes and the input supply was varied to values above and below 12V to test the circuit.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:orge6c97b9}
Table 1 shows how a smaller resistor value (bigger load) increases the ripple voltage. Since \(\tau = R \cdot C\) we know this is because the capacitor will discharge faster with a smaller resistance value, hence, the voltage will drop lower in the discharge time. Using a larger capacitor value reduces this ripple similarly, as the value of C in increased. By looking at the V\(_{\text{Avg}}\) values we can also deduce that a smaller ripple voltage leads to a higher average voltage. This makes sense as the voltage is kept at a higher level.\newline\newline
As the line voltage to the primary coil of the transformer is altered, the voltage at the secondary coil reduces or increases proportionally. The average voltage and ripple voltage also reduce or increase together with line voltage. This is an undesired result as the device being powered by our power supply might not be able to take 10 or 15V, but only 12-13V, and mains voltage can be unpredictable at times.\newline\newline
Adding the 5V regulator to the circuit demonstrated how the output voltage can be kept very constant. At input voltages above 6.56V, the output voltage was a steady 4.99V DC with ripple voltage that was indistinguishable from noise on the oscilloscope. Below this voltage, however, not enough voltage is supplied to the regulator and the output voltage begins to drop and the familiar ripple voltage from the unregulated power supply can be seen.
