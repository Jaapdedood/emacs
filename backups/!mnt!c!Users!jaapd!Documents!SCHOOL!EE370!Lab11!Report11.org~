* Introduction
In this lab, Proportional-Intergral-Derivative control (PID control) Was investigated. This is a control system that applies corrections based on three variables: the proportional, integral and derivative values of the error. The proportional term is directly proportional to the output error. Using car cruise control as an example, where speed is the output, the proportional term would simply be the amount of mph above or below the set speed multiplied by the gain factor "K". The integral term takes into account previous error in order to eliminate long lasting error. In the cruise-control example this makes sense; if the car is not reaching the set speed after a few seconds, the proportional drive is clearly not enough to reach the set speed in time. The last term, derivative measures the rate of change of the error. This allows the system to approach the setpoint more gradually, reducing overshoot and undershoot. This allows the car in our example to settle at the set speed without first accelerating and decelerating past the set speed.
* Activity 1
In this activity, the variation in PID variables and their effect on the output using a microcontroller was investigated using a simple light sensor circuit. The following plot was obtained by varying the light levels on a photoresistor.
