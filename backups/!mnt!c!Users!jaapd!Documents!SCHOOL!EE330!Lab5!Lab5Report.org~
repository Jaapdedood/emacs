* Abstract
In this lab, applications of using a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) in an unstabilized and stabilized common emitter configuration with, without and with partial degeneration were investigated. Each amplifier circuit was designed, debugged, and the values for R_i, R_o and A_v were measured. The effects of temperature and varying input loads were observed and potential improvements to the design attempted. The unstabilized design required the least components and was easy to design but the output varied greatly with temperature; from 80 at -51C to 187 at 25C. The stabilized common emitter configuration without degeneration had a lower gain of 170 (using a higher \beta transistor) but the gain only varied by 25 from -55 C to 125 C. The stabilized design with degeneration had an even lower gain of 10, but this did not vary at all with temperature.
* Introduction
The following unstabilized common emitter amplifier was designed for a DC operating point of about 1mA.

The resistor values were decided by deciding to allocate about 6V to V_{Rc} and 4V to V_{CE}. At an I_C of 1mA, this would require a 6K resistor. This is not a common resistor value, so a 5.1k was used instead. Next, knowing that 
\[I_C = \beta I_B\]
we know that at a \beta of roughly 400, 
\[I_B = \frac{1mA}{400} = 2.5\mu A\]
In the circuit shown,
\[I_B = \frac{V_{CC}-V_{BE}}{R_B} = \frac{10-0.6}{R_B} = 2.5\mu A\]
\[\implies R_B \approx 4M\]
(3M\Omega was used - see discussion). Our expected gain for this configuration, can be derived from the small-signal model of the circuit:

\[-\frac{v_{out}}{R_C} = g_m v_{\pi} \implies -\frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = A_V = -g_m R_C = -\frac{V_{R_C}}{V_T} = \frac{1.2mA \cdot 5.1k}{0.026} = 235\]
Likewise, the input and output resistances can be estimated.
\[R_{in} = r_{\pi} || R_B \approx r_{\pi} = \frac{\beta _0 V_T}{I_C} = 10.4K\Omega\]
\[R_{out} = R_c || R_0 \approx R_C = 5.1K\Omega\]

* Discussion
Initially, a 4M\Omega resistor was used, however, this was found to produce an I_C far below 1mA, so it was exchanged for a 3M\Omega resistor. This was probably because the actualy \beta of the transistor was below our estimated value of 400. Now, I_C was measured to be 1.2mA.\newline\newline
