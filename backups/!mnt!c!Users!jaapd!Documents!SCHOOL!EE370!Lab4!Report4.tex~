\section{Activity 4}
\label{sec:org19140f3}
In this activity the properties of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) were explored using the BASIC Stamp board and StampPlot software. First, the following circuit was built and the DataMonitoring.bs2 program from the previous lab was uploaded to the board.

\end{center}
The main feature of this circuit is the potentiometer connected across the 5V line to ground with the center tap connected to the base of a transistor. By turning the potentiometer, the 
resistance and hence the current to the base of the transistor is varied.\newline\newline
The amount of current at the base of the BJT,I\(_{\text{B}}\) controls the collector current, I\(_{\text{C}}\). Hence, varying the potentiometer varies the current conducted by the BJT. Below a certain base current, the BJT will act like an open switch as the resistance from collector to emitter is very high. This was noticed when conducting the experiment as the LED would not turn on until the potentiometer had been turned past a certain point. \newline Plotting V\(_{\text{P}}\) using StamPlot:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=200px]{image2.jpg}
\end{center}
It can be seen on the plot how the digital output from the ADC only becomes HIGH when the value of V\(_{\text{P}}\) falls slightly below 0.7V. As V\(_{\text{P}}\) drops, V\(_{\text{RB}}\) increases and hence I\(_{\text{B}}\) increases. When the ADC was then connected to the collector of the BJT the following plot was made:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image3.jpg}
\end{center}
As the potentiometer was turned in the same direction that caused V\(_{\text{P}}\) to drop, V\(_{\text{CE}}\) increased as shown on the plot. This time, the digital output of the ADC became HIGH as V\(_{\text{CE}}\) increased to above roughly 1.4V. For a large part of the turn in the potentiometer no effect was seen on the graph. This is because a potentiometer increases resistance logarithmically so only a small part of the turn operates the range of resistances we require. After turning the potentiometer a certain distance V\(_{\text{CE}}\) no longer increases, as the transistor is now in the saturation region. At this point, the transistor acts as a closed switch. On the plot this can be seen at roughly 4.8V, which is correct since V\(_{\text{dd}}\) = 5V and at saturation a transistor drops around 0.7V. 
\section{Activity 5}
\label{sec:org40adeeb}
In this activity the same circuit and code were used as in Activity 4. However, this time a different StampPlot macro was used to plot the data. Rather than plotting voltage against time, this macro plots a DC load line for R\(_{\text{C}}\) and the power dissipated by the transistor. By running macro and slowly turning the potentiometer the following plot was drawn:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image4.jpg}
\end{center}
As you can see I\(_{\text{C}}\) linearly decreases as V\(_{\text{C}}\) Increases. This is because at saturation the transistor is fully conducting hence V\(_{\text{C}}\) is close to 0V and I\(_{\text{C}}\) is at a maximum. As V\(_{\text{C}}\) increases, this means the transistor is allowing less current through the collector. As the power dissipated by the transistor is the product of I\(_{\text{C}}\) and V\(_{\text{C}}\) the max power occurs halfway between saturation and cutoff.\newline\newline
Next, the resistor at the collector of the transistor, R\(_{\text{C}}\), was changed from 1k\(\Omega\) to 10k\(\Omega\) which produced the following plot.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image5.jpg}
\end{center}
This time the current and power values are smaller by a factor of 10 as the resistance was increased by a factor of 10. One aspect not shown on the plot is the movement of the potentiometer during this plot. It was extremely difficult to obtain a good resolution of samples for this plot by turning the potentiometer as a very slight turn of the potentiometer covered the entire active range of the transistor. This is because with a larger resistance at the collector of the BJT, I\(_{\text{SAT}}\) is now much smaller, hence, a smaller I\(_{\text{B}}\) is required for saturation and a smaller turn of the potentiometer.\newline\newline
Next, R\(_{\text{C}}\) was changed back to 1k\(\Omega\) but the resistance at the base, R\(_{\text{B}}\), was changed from 47k\(\Omega\) to 10k\(\Omega\). This produced the following plot:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image6.jpg}
\end{center}
This plot looks identical to the first plot from this activity, as the current and power values are equal. However, like the last plot, this range of values occured over a very small range of potentiometer values as a smaller R\(_{\text{B}}\) allows a larger I\(_{\text{B}}\) to pass.
\section{Challenge 3-5}
\label{sec:orgc826378}
In this challenge, a 100k\(\Omega\) resistor was now used for R\(_{\text{C}}\) and the resulting load line was plotted.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=300px]{image7.jpg}
\end{center}
This plot may look messy, but a general shape resembling that of the earlier plots can be seen. by increasing R\(_{\text{C}}\) by a factor of 100, the current and power have also reduced by a factor of 100. The plot's messy appearance is due to this current being so low and only being measured to roughly the nearest 0.01mA, causing a much larger \% error in the readings.
\section{Activity 6 / Challenge 3-6}
\label{sec:orga6199f2}
This activity was simply a discussion about how a transistor circuit can be designed to act very similar to a pushbutton switch circuit such as those used in earlier labs. In the common-emitter configuration, a transistor acts like a pushbutton switch with a pull-up resistor, and in common-collector configuration it acts like a pushbutton switch with pull-down resistor. \newline\newline The base current in a common collector configuration can be calculated by
\[I_B =\frac{V_I - 0.7V}{h_{FE}R_E+R_B}\]
If R\(_{\text{E}}\) was decreased to 100\(\Omega\) with a V\(_{\text{in}}\) of 5V and R\(_{\text{B}}\) of 47k\(\Omega\) the base current, assuming h\(_{\text{FE}}\)=100 would be \(I_B=\frac{5V-0.7V}{(100)(100)+47k\Omega}=0.075mA\). The collector current, I\(_{\text{C}}\) can be calculated by \[I_C = I_Bh_{FE}\]Hence, for our circuit \(I_B = (100)(0.075mA) = 7.5mA\)
