\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgdb0a3ac}
The initial goal of this project was to make an Internet of Things
(IoT) project in the form of a Wi-Fi greenhouse. While doing research
on greenhouse technology I stumbled upon a \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJRrjxOcA9I}{Youtube clip} of the BBC
show "It's Not Easy Being Green" in which a greenhouse is displayed
that uses an insulated box of soil buried underground as a heatsink to
maintain the temperature in the greenhouse constant. Whether it worked
or not was not shown and I was only able to find one or two other
examples of a similar system online, both poorly executed.  This
greenhouse is intended as an experiment to test if such a system would
provide sufficient heating and cooling to maintain optimal temperature
for plant growth. Additionally it will be an project in electronics as
a combination of microcontrollers will be used to data log various
environmental variables and allow the greenhouse to be monitored over
wifi.
