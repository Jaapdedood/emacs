\label{sec:org33c7236}
In this lab, the output characteristics of a Junction Gate Field-Effect-Transistor (JFET) were plotted by measuring I\(_{\text{D}}\) vs V\(_{\text{DS}}\) at different values of V\(_{\text{GS}}\) and I\(_{\text{D}}\) vs V\(_{\text{GS}}\). From these graphs, V\(_{\text{P}}\) and I\(_{\text{DSS}}\) for our NTE457 JFET were estimated to be -2V and 2mA respectively. Using the same JFET, an unstabilized common-source amplifier was designed and tested. The output values were then compared using different JFETs of the same number. Heating was found to decrease the output gain and cooling increased the gain. The input resistance was found to be very large (\(\approx\) \(\infty\)). The same procedure was repeated with a stabilized design. The temperature effects observed were less significant but the measured gain was less.
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgadb0326}
A JFET is the simplest type of FET. It consists of an n or p-type channel of which the two ends are assigned to be the "drain" and "source" with a p or n-type "gate" along the length of the channel. 
As with any p-n junction, there is a depletion region surrounding the junction that increases in size when a reverse bias is applied. This means that if the JFET is connected in common source configuration, with the gate used as the input and drain as output, the output current is reduced by reverse biasing the gate-source junction. This is because as the depletion region increases in width, the conductive area in the channel between drain and source decreases in width which reduces the conductivity and thus the current allowed through. This relationship between V\(_{\text{GS}}\) and I\(_{\text{D}}\) will be measured and plotted. \newline\newline
At a certain V\(_{\text{GS}}\), the channel will no longer conduct any significant current. This is called the pinch-off voltage: V\(_{\text{P}}\). A JFET should practically always be utilized in reverse bias or at 0V. The current that the device conducts at saturation and at a V\(_{\text{GS}}\) of 0V is known as the drain to source saturation current, or I\(_{\text{DSS}}\). Using these variables, an equation characterizing the drain current through a JFET can be written.
\begin{equation}
I_D = I_{DSS}(1-\frac{V_{GS}}{V_P})^2
\end{equation}
The effective drain to source resistance of the FET can be written as:
\[R_{DS} = \frac{V_{GS}}{I_D} = \frac{1}{g_m}\]
Where g\(_{\text{m}}\) is the transconductance. In a common source amplifier such as the one that will be designed in this lab, this is the proportionality constant for the gain:
\[A_V = g_m R_D\]
Using this information, an unstabilized JFET amplifier was designed using separate power supplies for the base and drain.

The characteristics of a NTE457 JFET will be observed by altering either supply voltages to alter V\(_{\text{GS}}\) or V\(_{\text{DS}}\). The difference in characteristics between different devices of the same number and the temperature effects will be observed by cooling the device with a freeze spray and heating it using a soldering iron.\newline\newline
The input resistance of the circuit can also be measured by AC coupling a potentiometer to the input and increasing the resistance until the output on seen on the oscilloscope is halved in amplitude.\newline\newline
Next, a stabilized amplifier was designed by self-biasing the FET. This was done by using the transfer characteristic curve obtained for the NTE457 used in the previous section to estimate a reasonable operating point and the V\(_{\text{G}}\) and source resistance required to obtain this. These values are obtained by extrapolating a line between the min and max drain current to the V\(_{\text{GS}}\) axis to find V\(_{\text{G}}\). The slope of this line is \(\frac{1}{R_S}\).

Using an operating point of roughly 300\(\mu\) A and V\(_{\text{G}}\) of 1.2V, the following circuit was constructed.
Like the last design, the operating point, input resistance, voltage gain and effects of temperature were measured.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:orga5410e9}
For the transfer characteristic of our JFET, a second order parabola trendline fits the datapoints very well. This is correct as it should follow equation (1), which is a second order power law. From the graph it can be seen that I\(_{\text{DSS}}\) is about 2mA and the pinch-off voltage is roughly -2V. The datasheet for this transistor states an I\(_{\text{DSS}}\) of 1 to 5mA and a V\(_{\text{P}}\) of 6V Max so this agrees with our measured values.\newline\newline
When comparing the various transistors of the same type certain transistors exhibit an unexpected amount of current at 800\(\mu\) A. The results were fairly consistent around either 350\(\mu\) or 800\(\mu\) A 
so the transistors purchased are likely to be two different batches with different but consistent characteristics.\newline\newline
The drain characteristics measured also resemble the curves seen in datasheets. The initial, steeply sloped, area of the of each curve represents the "ohmic region" of the JFET where it is unsuitable for amplification as the output signal will be distorted. At the point where the slop flattens out, the device is in saturation. This particular JFET could potentially cause quite some noise at a V\(_{\text{GS}}\) > -1V as the curves are still rather unpredictable below this voltage, even at high V\(_{\text{DS}}\) values.\newline\newline
This is probably not a big issue for this JFET though as JFETs are not as effective at amplifying as BJTs. This can be seen by the gains of both amplifier designs. The voltage gain of a stabilized BJT amplifier can easily reach 200+ wherease the gains of the JFET amplifiers in this experiment did not even exceed 20. An advantage of using a FET, however, is that the input resistance is substantially higher. This can be seen by the measured input resistances that resemble almost purely R1||R2. This is because the input resistance of the FET is enough orders of magnitude higher to have negligible effects on the input resistance, especially with low biasing resistances such as those used in the unstabilized design.\newline\newline
Having a lower voltage gain, JFETs are also less temperature dependant than BJTs. This can be seen by our results as, even in the unstabilized design, the output current only varies by about 20 \(\mu\) A. In the stabilized design the gain varied by about 1 unit. The gain decreases with increased temperature because, even though the threshhold voltage decreases as temperature increases, the drain current makes a net. decrease as the carrier mobility decreases with temperature which has the largest effect on the output current.
